 -- note -- if you dunno django, then go forward with node.js with using Sequelize. But django would be preferred. 
# Requirements / Tasks

# 1. Please change the models so that the following functionality works. How do you test it?

# - A Company can have one or more offices
# - Offices can be an headquarter.
# - A company should at all times have exactly one headquarter

# 2. Please add an API with the help of django-rest-framework. How would you test the functionality?

# - Write an API endpoint to create the company along with office information
# - Write an simple read-only API endpoint for companies to get the company name + street+postal_code+city from the headquarter office
# - Write an simple read-only API endpoint to get all the offices for a company
# - Write an API endpoint to change the headquarter of the company

# 3. Make a simple React app to show above API usability as much as possible (no designs here, it's all up to you), but should use Redux lifecycle.

# 4. BONUS:

# - Customize the API endpoint to include the sum of rent for all offices of a Company. How would you approach / test this?
